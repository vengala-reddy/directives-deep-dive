## Understanding Directives
Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications. They can be categorized into three types: components, attribute directives, and structural directives.

## Analyzing Built-in Attribute Directives
Built-in attribute directives such as `ngModel` are used to change the appearance or behavior of DOM elements.


## Custom Directives
Custom directives allow you to create reusable behaviors that can be applied to elements in your templates.

## Using Attribute Directives to Change Element Behavior
Attribute directives can be used to dynamically change the behavior or appearance of elements based on application state.

## Working with `input()` in Custom Directives
The `input()` decorator allows you to pass data from a parent component to a directive, enabling dynamic behavior based on input properties.

## Directives & Dependency Injection
Directives can leverage Angular's dependency injection system to access services and other dependencies.

## Building a Custom Structural Directive
Custom structural directives can be created to manipulate the DOM structure based on application logic.

## Structural Directives & Syntactic Sugar
Structural directives often use syntactic sugar to simplify the template syntax, making it more readable and maintainable.

## Host Directive & Composition
Host directives allow you to apply behaviors to the host element of a component or another directive, enabling composition of behaviors.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive guide to working with Angular directives, covering essential concepts and best practices.
